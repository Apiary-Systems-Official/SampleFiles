--hello_drone & survey--
Forgot to upload these. Pretty basic code, many lines copied from AirSim's official documentation. Both used python, notes from code
- This will not run on Python 3.13, I recommend you make a new environment with Python 3.8.10(https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3810/)
- When running C++ files with AirSim, make sure the drop down menu between debug and local windows debugger is in x64 NOT x86, it will not compile that way
- These will all be used from the AirSim folder in your repo folder NOT your plugins (pinning this folder to your file explorer is recommended)
